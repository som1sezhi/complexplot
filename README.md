# complexplot

A simple complex function plotter that uses [domain coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring) to visualize functions. Can be found [here](https://som1sezhi.github.io/complexplot/).

It should be noted that I'm not an expert in numerical computation, and many functions can return quite inaccurate results outside a moderate range. This may improve in the future as I come across better algorithms.
